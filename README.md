# voice-based-text-summarization
Text summarization is the process of generating a shorter version of  the input text which captures its most important information.
A large fraction of the data is in the form of text documents ranging from news articles to e-books. 
Often these documents are verbose and require long reading time which one typically wants to avoid. 
Hence, the need of summarizing these documents arises.
	So, to summarize the text we use extractive text summarization technique, in that we use single -domain-multiple-documents summarization 
 i.e., we will take multiple articles as input and generate a single bullet-pointÂ summary. 
 Using Graph-Methods which includes Cosine-Similarity and Text-Rank algorithm.
